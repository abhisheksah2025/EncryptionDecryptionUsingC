# Encryption Decryption Using C
Repository Description for GitHub

**File Encryption and Decryption System**
A C-based program for encrypting and decrypting files using the XOR method. This program allows users to secure their files by applying a user-defined key for encryption or decryption. It works on binary files, ensuring compatibility with all file types.

**Features:**
**Encryption and Decryption:** Uses XOR-based encryption, which is reversible using the same key.
**File Compatibility:** Supports binary files, including text, images, videos, and more.
**Custom Key Support:** Allows users to specify their own encryption/decryption key.
**Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.


### Files in the Repository:
**main.c:** This is the source code file containing the C program. It includes the logic for encrypting and decrypting files using the XOR method.
**main.o:** This is the compiled object file generated from main.c during the compilation process. It contains the machine-level code and is an intermediate step in producing the executable.
**main.exe:** This is the executable file generated after compiling main.c. It is the final program that can be run to perform the file encryption and decryption tasks.
**README.md:** Documentation and details about the project (this file).
